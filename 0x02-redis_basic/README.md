Writing Strings to Redis (Cache class with store method)

This task emphasizes understanding how to interact with Redis in Python using the redis library.
It teaches how to store data in Redis by generating a unique key (via uuid) and using Redis commands to store various data types (str, bytes, int, float).
Type annotation is practiced, which is important for ensuring correct data types and enhancing code clarity.
Handling different data types and converting them to and from byte strings demonstrates the importance of data serialization when working with Redis, a database that only supports certain data types.
Reading from Redis and Recovering Original Types

This task teaches the challenges of serialization and deserialization. When data is retrieved from Redis, it may be returned as byte strings, and converting it back to the original type is a key concept.
The Cache.get method, which optionally uses a conversion function (fn), highlights the flexibility needed when working with Redis and Python data types.
This task also teaches how to handle missing data gracefully, as Redis will return None if a key doesn't exist.
The importance of data integrity and conversion functions (for string and integer values) is demonstrated here.
Incrementing Values (Decorator for Counting Calls)

This task teaches how to create decorators in Python, which are useful for modifying the behavior of functions or methods dynamically.
You’ll learn how to implement a decorator (count_calls) that increments Redis-stored values each time a method is called. This requires the ability to track method invocations and store that information in Redis.
By using __qualname__ to uniquely identify method calls, you practice method identification in the context of object-oriented programming.
It reinforces the use of functools.wraps to ensure that the wrapped function retains its original name, docstring, and other metadata.
Storing Lists (History of Function Calls)

This task introduces how to use Redis lists to store sequences of data (via rpush for appending to the list).
Storing input arguments and output results in different lists allows you to create a history of method calls, which is a common need in caching and logging systems.
You'll also become familiar with how to deal with Redis commands like RPUSH and LRANGE to manage and retrieve lists.
The concept of function decorators is further reinforced, but this time to track both inputs and outputs separately, which is valuable for debugging and auditing.
Retrieving Lists (Replay History of Calls)

This task extends the use of Redis by requiring you to replay the history of function calls. By combining list retrieval (lrange) with Zipping to correlate inputs and outputs, this task teaches how to reassemble and present historical data in a human-readable format.
The key takeaway is how to combine data retrieval and formatting to build a replay mechanism, allowing users to see previous calls to methods and their results.
Overall Insights:

These tasks collectively provide a deep dive into working with Redis in Python—a common tool used for caching, session management, and storing temporary data in web development and distributed systems.
You’ll learn how to handle data serialization, method tracking, and call history using Redis, which is an essential skill for building scalable, efficient systems.
You’ll also gain practical experience with Python decorators, UUIDs, Redis data types, and handling method invocations, all of which are widely used in backend development and caching systems.
